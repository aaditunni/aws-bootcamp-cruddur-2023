# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

I completed all the required tasks in the TODO list in the Students Portal. Here is a breakdown of all the things I did.

- Watched the week 2 live stream video along with supplementary videos to complete the following tasks:
    - Instrumented Honeycomb with OTEL.
    - Instrumented AWS X-Ray and viewed the traces.
    - Instrumented AWS X-Ray Subsegments to view traces for the mock-data.
    - Got test logs in CloudWatch Logs by configuring a custom logger. Had an error when I tried docker-compose up as I made mistake with the spelling of logger by using uppercase for the L in logger.
    - Integrated Rollbar and captured success and error logs in the Items section.
    - Watched Watch Chirag Week 2 - Spending Considerations and Ashish's Week 2 - Observability Security Considerations.
    - Integrated Codespaces with my project so that if by any chance my GitPod free tier is exhausted then I can switch to Codespaces without any hassle.

    I found this week's concepts pretty complicated but understood some basics which I had no idea about. Following along the videos was easy and didn't come across any such difficulties but the whole concept of Distributed tracing is new to me so it felt a bit overwhelming. One thing I loved about this week's live stream video was the guest instructor. The session felt lively and enjoyable when there was lots of talking and laughter and not like those typical boring classrooms.
